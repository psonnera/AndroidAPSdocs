## AAPS app

### Building & updating

### Installing

You may see a Google Play Protect warning that the app is unsafe, was built for older Android versions and doesn't include latest privacy protections.

Ignore it: More details, Install anyway.

### Cannot start Omnipod with Android 16

Upgrade to minimum version of AndroidAPS: 3.3.2.1.

### Frequent Bluetooth connection problems

#### Android 15

After upgrading Android or moving to a recent phone, **AAPS** frequently loses Bluetooth connection to the pump. The problem disappears temporarily when restarting the phone. If the phone runs Android 15, you can try to enable the following:

1) **Open preferences** by clicking the three-dot menu on the top right side of the home screen.

2. Scroll down and open the **Confirmation beeps** / **Advanced** submenu. Enable **Bond BT device on Android 15+**.

3. If the pump asks for a pairing request, accept it.

4. Restart your phone.

#### Battery optimization

This can happen with various pumps. Apart from excluding AAPS from any battery optimization, you can also exclude the system Bluetooth app from battery optimization. This can help in some cases. Depending on the phone you use, you will find the Bluetooth app differently.

Here are examples how to find them on specific android phones.


##### Pixel phones (stock Android)

* Go to the android settings, select "Apps".
