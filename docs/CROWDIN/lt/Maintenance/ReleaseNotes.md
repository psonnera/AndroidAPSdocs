![Update info](../images/AAPS_LoopDisable90days.png)

This prompt is important, should not be ignored and is not intended to bug you. New versions of **AAPS** do not only provide new features but also important safety fixes. Therefore it is necessary that every **AAPS** user updates to the latest version a.s.a.p.. Unfortunately there are still bug reports from very old versions so this an effort to try to improve the safety for each **AAPS** user and the DIY community. Thank you for your understanding.

```{admonition} First version of **AAPS**
:class: note

The first test version started already in 2015. In 2016 has been the first released version.

The chronology of these releases is not available at the moment but as this questions is asked severeal times we document it here.

* **[Dynamic ISF](../DailyLifeWithAaps/DynamicISF.md)** feature is no more a dedicated plugin, but is now included as an option of [OpenAPS SMB](#Config-Builder-aps) plugin, along with some changes in its behaviour:
  * **Profile Switch** and **Profile Percentage** is now taken into account for **Dynamic ISF** in respect of dynamic sensitivity strengthness
  * The average **ISF** of the last 24h is calculated and this value is used for bolus wizard and **COB** calculation. **Profile ISF** value is not used at all (except fallback when history data is not available)
  * DynamicISF documentation page has been rewritten. Please read the important section [Things to consider when activating Dynamic ISF](#dyn-isf-things-to-consider-when-activating-dynamicisf).

### How to upgrade

* Before upgrading:
  * **<span style="color:red">This version requires Google Android 11.0 or above</span>**. Check your phone version before attempting to update.
  * If you use the “old” Combo driver with ruffy device, migrate to the [native Combo driver](../CompatiblePumps/Accu-Chek-Combo-Pump-v2.md) before update
  * You will lose your [additional graphs](#AapsScreens-section-g-additional-graphs) on the HomeScreen during upgrade: make a manual note of your current configuration if needed, so that you can recreate them after upgrade.
  * The [Bluetooth connectivity issues some people encounter on Android 15](../Getting-Started/Phones.md) are **NOT** solved by this release (this is an Android issue, not **AAPS**). A fix is available in 3.3.1.2.
  * The BYODA button on the homescreen is no longer available due to Android limitations. This is fixed in 3.3.1.2.
* Update instructions: follow the [Update to a new version](../Maintenance/UpdateToNewVersion.md) guide.
  * [Android Studio version called "Ladybug"](#Building-APK-recommended-specification-of-computer-for-building-apk-file) or above is required to build this version. If you already have an older version of Android Studio installed, you may need to <span style="color:red">configure the JVM version to 21</span>. See [Troubleshooting Android Studio > Incompatible Gradle JVM](#incompatible-gradle-jvm).
  * Tip - if you do not want to lose your **AAPS** history ALWAYS do an UPDATE and NOT an UNINSTALL/INSTALL. As a precaution, back up your current **AAPS** settings and old APK to revert to an old version should anything go wrong.
* After upgrading:
  * Set the new [“AAPS directory” setting](#preferences-maintenance-logdirectory), in the Maintenance tab.

## Version 3.2.0.0 dedicated to @Philoul

Release date: 23-10-2023

### Important hints

- NS 15 is required
- While using websockets in NS v3 plugin treatments entered through NS UI (plus button) and other applications using v1 API are not sent to AAPS. This will be fixed in future release of NS. Always use the same client (v1 or v3) in AAPS and AAPSClient until NS fully switch to v3 internaly. The same is valid for AAPS and AAPSClient itself.
- Websockets in v3 plugin works similiar way to v1 plugin. Without websockets enabled AAPS schedules regularly downloads from NS which should lead to lower power consumption because NS is not permanently connected. On the oposite side it means delays in exchanging data. Please read [here](#Important-comments-on-using-v3-versus-v1-API-for-Nightscout-with-AAPS) the important comments from the dev team before you use it!
- If you are using xdrip as cgm source you must select it again after update due to internal changes
- Tidepool can be used as a replacement of NS to pass first objective
- If you send to xDrip+ you must configure xDrip synchronization plugin. In order to receive BGs from AAPS in xDrip, “xDrip+ Sync Follower” must be selected as source
- If you want to switch to ComboV2 driver, Ruffy must be uninstalled and pump paired again to AAPS
- In order to use DynISF plugin you have to start Objective 11 (all previous must be in finished state to allow start of 11)

(Important-comments-on-using-v3-versus-v1-API-for-Nightscout-with-AAPS)=
### Important comments on using v3 versus v1 API for Nightscout with AAPS

v1 is the old protocol used for exchanging data between NS web site and NS server. It has many limitations
- v1 sends only 2 days of data
- v1 send all 2 days data on every reconnection
- using websockets is mandatory = permanent connection, more battery compsumption
- during frequent disconnects to NS connection is paused for 15 minutes to prevent high data usage

v3 is new protocol. More safe and efficient
- while using tokens you can better define access rights
- protocol is more efficient on both sides (AAPS & NS)
- It can read up to 3 months of data from NS
- you can choose to use or to not use websockets on every device (using means faster updates, not using means lower power compsumption, but slower updates ie. minutes)
- NSClient is not paused on disconnections

LIMITATIONS
- NS 15 must be used with AAPS 3.2
- v3 doesn't see updates done by v1 protocol (probably it will be resolved in some future version of NS)
- in opposite because of old uneffective method of tracking changes v1 see changes done by v3
- remember NS still uses v1 internaly so far thus is not possible to enter data through NS web UI if you are using v3. You must use AAPSClient on SMS if you want enter data remotely

RECOMMENDED SETTING
- because of all above you should choose only one method and use it on all devices (remember all other uploaders at time of writing this are using v1). If you decide to go to v3, select v3 in AAPS and all AAPSClients
- v3 is preffered because of efficiency
- using websockets or not using with v3 depends on your preference
- it HIGHLY recommended to let AAPS gather all data and then upload it to NS as a single uploader. All other devices/applications should only read from NS. By doing it you'll prevent conflicts and sync errors. This is valid for getting BG data to NS using Dexcom Share connector etc. too

## Version 3.0.0

Release date: 31-01-2022

(Releasenotes-important-hints-3-0-0)=
### Important hints

- **Minimum Android version is 9.0 now.**
- **Data is not migrated to new database.** Do not complain, it's so huge change so it's simply not possible. Thus after update IOB, COB, treatments etc. will be cleared. You have to create new [profile switch](../DailyLifeWithAaps/ProfileSwitch-ProfilePercentage.md) and start with zero IOB and COB. Plan the update carefully!!! Best in situation without active insulin and carbs
- Use the same version of AAPS and NSClient

**Make sure to check and adjust settings after updating to 3.0 as described** [here](../Maintenance/Update3_0.md).

### Preparation steps

**At least two days before update:**

- disable Dexcom bridge in Nightscout
- if you are using G5/G6 and xDrip as a collector, you have to update xDrip to a nightly version newer than 14th January 2022
- if you are using G5/G6 switching to BYODA as collector is recommended to take advantage of back-smoothing (you can still use xDrip for other purposes, xDrip can receive data from BYODA)

(important-hints-2-8-1-1)=
### Important hints

- Option **NS_UPLOAD_ONLY** has been forced ON for all 2.8.1 users.
- If you use NSClient to enter TT, carbs or profile switches you must turn it off in AAPS but **only in case your synchronization is working well** (ie. you don't see unwanted data changes like self modification of TT, TBR etc).
- ATTENTION: DO NOT do this if you have any other app handle treatments ( like xDrip broadcast/upload/sync...).

(Releasenotes-settings-to-adjust-when-switching-from-ama-to-smb)=
### Settings to adjust when switching from AMA to SMB

- Objective 10 must be started for SMBs to be enabled (SMB tab generally shows what restrictions apply)

- maxIOB now includes \_all\_ IOB, not just added basal. That is, if given a bolus of 8 U for a meal and maxIOB is 7 U, no SMBs will be delivered until IOB drops below 7 U.

- min_5m_carbimpact default has changed from 3 to 8 going from AMA to SMB. If you are upgrading from AMA to SMB, you have to change it manually

- Note when building AAPS 2.0 apk: Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version of the Android Gradle plugin! If your build fails with an error regarding "on demand configuration" you can do the following:

  - Open the Preferences window by clicking File > Settings (on Mac, Android Studio > Preferences).
  - In the left pane, click Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler.
  - Uncheck the Configure on demand checkbox.
  - Click Apply or OK.

(Releasenotes-overview-tab)=
### Overview tab
