# Telefones

The current version of **AAPS** (3.3) requires an Android smartphone with Google **Android 11.0 or above**. If you are considering buying a new phone, (as of December 2024), **Android 14 is preferred**.

Check [Facebook or Discord](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md) for latest updates on this subject.

Users are strongly encouraged to keep their build of **AAPS** up to date for safety reasons. However, for users unable to use a device with Android 11.0 or newer, earlier versions of **AAPS** compatible for older Android versions, remain available, see: [Release notes](#maintenance-android-version-aaps-version).

## List of tested Phones

We maintain a list of the [tested hardware setups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vScCNaIguEZVTVFAgpv1kXHdsHl3fs6xT6RB2Z1CeVJ561AvvqGwxMhlmSHk4J056gMCAQE02sAWJvT/pubhtml?gid=683363241&single=true).

This list provides user feedback on the usage of a phone along with **AAPS** and a given pump and CGM. It can help you check if your phone / pump / CGM has been used successfully by other users.

The document is read-only. With CRTL-F, you can search in the text of the Google sheet.

To record your test of a hardware setup, please fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoGKLYEx4aUAJ5RWL3xLJeNdmRyxtXmDzpGhuU3Rfcj2H_Jw/viewform). After you fill in the form data, the sheet is updated automatically every 5 minutes

Any problems with the spreadsheet, please contact its maintainer, *@theodoor5137*, on Discord, or see the [Where can I get help? page](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md).

## I didn't find my phone

If you have questions regarding a specific phone model, please search or ask in our [Facebook or Discord community](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md).

To make a donation of smartphone or smartwatch models that still need testing, please email <donations@androidaps.org>.
