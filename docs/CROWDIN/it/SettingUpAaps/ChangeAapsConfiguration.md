# Making changes to your AAPS' configuration

After you have completed the **[Setup Wizard](../SettingUpAaps/SetupWizard.md)**, you don't need to run the entire Wizard again if you want to only change parts of your **AAPS**' configuration.

There are three routes to change AAPSâ€™ configuration. As to which route you take, it is simply a matter of convenience or personal preference as each route leads to the same configuration settings.

These are as follows:

1. Config builder,
1. Three dot menu on the right and select "Preferences" or
1. Three dot menu on the right and select "Plugin preferences".

Here we explain which option is most convenient for each situation:

## Config builder

The **config builder** is used if you want to **enable plugins** and their **visibility** in the top level menu. Once enabled, the **plugins** will always run, and you can decide if you want to be able to see them in the top menu or not. Disabled plugins can not be made visible.

You can use the cogwheel next to each activated plugin to access its settings.

The documentation relating to the config builder is available [here](../SettingUpAaps/ConfigBuilder.md).

## Preferences

The **preferences** dialogue can be reached via the top right _three dots_ menu on any tab of **AAPS**. This allows to change the configuration of **all enabled plugins in a single place**.

This is a good route if you are not really sure where to look for a configuration option, but it can be a bit tedious if you know you want to change the configuration for just one specific plugin.

The documentation of the preferences is available [here](../SettingUpAaps/Preferences.md).

## Plugin preferences

The **plugin preferences** dialogue can be reached via the top right _three dots_ menu on the home screen of **AAPS**. It allows to change the configuration of the **plugin currently on screen**.

For example, this is a good route if you know that you want to change the configuration for BYODA. Then, you would select the tab "BYODA" on the top menu of **AAPS**, and then once you are on the BYODA page, in the top right, select the _three dots_ menu and then the "plugin preferences" entry. You are taken directly to the preferences dialogue specifically for the BYODA plugin.

This is a "shortcut" to the general preferences dialogue, the documentation of the preferences is available [here](../SettingUpAaps/Preferences.md).
