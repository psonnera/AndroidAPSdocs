## Vyrobte si místo stažení

**The AAPS app (an apk file) is not available for download, due to regulations around medical devices. Je legální vytvořit aplikaci pro své vlastní použití, ale nesmíte dát kopii ostatním!**

See [FAQ page](../UsefulLinks/FAQ.md) for details.

## Computer and software specifications for building AAPS 3.2.0.4

* A specific **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)** version may be required to build the apk.

| AAPS Version            | Preferred<br/>Android Studio<br/>Version | Alternative<br/>Android Studio<br/>Version | Gradle | JVM |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |:--- |
| [3.2.0.4](#version3200) | Hedgehog (2023.1.1)                                  | up to Meerkat                                          | 8.2    | 17  |

The "preferred version" is packaged with the appropriate JVM version. The preferred version is also the minimal version you can use to build **AAPS**. You will **NOT** be able to build on a version older than the "preferred" one. If using a different version, you may encounter issues related to JVM version. See the [Troubleshooting Android Studio](#troubleshooting_androidstudio-uncommitted-changes) page to help solve these issues. If your current Android Studio version is not listed in the table, you must update it first.

The Gradle version is linked to the source code, you will always get the correct Gradle version when downloading / updating the source code. It is mentioned here for reference only, you don't have to take action on it.

* [Windows 32-bit systems](#troubleshooting_androidstudio-unable-to-start-daemon-process) are not supported by Android Studio. Please keep in mind that both **64 bit CPU and 64 bit OS are mandatory condition.** If your system DOES NOT meet this condition, you have to change affected hardware or software or the whole system.

**It is strongly recommended (not mandatory) to use SSD (Solid State Disk) instead of HDD (Hard Disk Drive) because it will take less time when you are building the AAPS apk file.**  You can still use a HDD when you are building the **AAPS** apk file. Pokud to uděláte, dokončení procesu sestavení může trvat dlouho, ale jakmile začnete, můžete ho nechat bez dozoru.

## Help and support during 3.2.0.4 building process

If you run into difficulties in the process of building the **AAPS** app, there is a dedicated [**troubleshooting Android Studio**](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/3.2/GettingHelp/TroubleshootingAndroidStudio.html) section, please consult that first.

If you think something in the building instructions is wrong, missing or confusing, or you are still struggling, please reach out to other **AAPS** users group on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AndroidAPSUsers) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/4fQUWHZ4Mw). If you want to change something yourself (updating screenshots _etc_), please submit a [pull request (PR)](../SupportingAaps/HowToEditTheDocs.md).

### Build the Signed 3.2.0.4 APK

Your sourcecode is now the current released version, and all prerequisites have been checked. It's time to build the signed apk as described in the [build signed apk section](#Building-APK-generate-signed-apk).

### Transfer and install the 3.2.0.4 APK

You need to transfer the apk to your phone so you can install it.

```{note}
If you completed the build with the same existing key store in Android Studio, then you do not need to remove the existing app on your phone. When you install the apk, follow the prompts to install updates.
For other scenarios such as establishing a new key store in Android Studio for your signed apk, you will need to delete the old app before installing the apk. **Make sure to export your settings!**
```

See the instructions for [transferring and installing AAPS](../SettingUpAaps/TransferringAndInstallingAaps.md)

### Check AAPS version 3.2.0.4 on phone

After you installed the new apk, you can check the AAPS version on your phone by clicking the three dots menu on the top right and then About. You should see the current version.
