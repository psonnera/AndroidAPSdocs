# Konfigurace

Depending on your settings you can open Config Builder through a tab at the top of **AAPS**' screen or through the hamburger menu.

![Otevřít průvodce konfigurací](../images/ConfBuild_Open_AAPS30.png)

The **Config Builder** is the tab where you turn the modular features on and off. In the picture below, the boxes on the left-hand side (A) allow you to select which modules you want activated. By default, when opening the Config Builder, sections are collapsed to only show the active plugins. Click on the arrow (G) to show all available options. The boxes on the right-hand side (C) allow you to view the active modules as a tab (E) in **AAPS**. In case the right box is not activated, you can reach the function by using the hamburger menu (D) on the top left of the screen. See [Tab or hamburger menu](#tab-or-hamburger-menu) below.

When there are additional settings available within the module, you can click on the cog wheel (B) which will take you to the specific settings within preferences.

## Profile

This module can not be disabled as it is a core part of **AAPS**.

See [Your AAPS Profile](../SettingUpAaps/YourAapsProfile.md) for a basic understanding of what goes inside your **Profile**.

(Config-Builder-insulin)=

## Inzulín

![Insulin type](../images/ConfBuild_Insulin_AAPS30.png)

Select the type of insulin you are using.

More information to understand the Insulin Profile as shown in **AAPS** [here](#AapsScreens-insulin-profile).

### Rozdíly v typu inzulínu

* The options 'Rapid-Acting Oref', Ultra-Rapid Oref', 'Lyumjev' and 'Free-Peak Oref' all have an exponential shape.
* For 'Rapid-Acting', 'Ultra-Rapid' and 'Lyumjev' the DIA is the only variable you can adjust by yourself, the time to peak is fixed. 
* Free-Peak allows you to adjust both the DIA and the time to peak, and must only be used by advanced users who know the effects of these settings. 
* The [insulin curve graph](#AapsScreens-insulin-profile) helps you to understand the different curves.

#### Rychle působící - Oref

![Insulin type Rapid-Acting Oref](../images/ConfBuild_Insulin_RAO.png)

* recommended for Humalog, Novolog and Novorapid
* DIA = alespoň 5 h
* Max. peak = 75 minutes after injection (fixed, not adjustable)

#### Ultra rychlý - Oref

## Detekce citlivosti

Select the type of sensitivity detection. For more details of different designs please [read on here](../DailyLifeWithAaps/SensitivityDetectionAndCob.md). This will analyze historical data on the go and make adjustments if it recognizes that you are reacting more sensitively (or conversely, more resistant) to insulin than usual. More details about the Sensitivity algorithm can be read in the [OpenAPS docs](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/Customize-Iterate/autosens.html).

You can view your sensitivity on the homescreen in an [additional graph](#AapsScreens-section-g-additional-graphs). You can view your sensitivity on the homescreen by selecting SEN and watching the white line. Note, you need to be in [Objective 8](#objectives-objective8) in order to let Sensitivity Detection/[Autosens](#Open-APS-features-autosens) automatically adjust the amount of insulin delivered. Before reaching that objective, the Autosens percentage / the line in your graph is displayed for information only.

### Nastavení absorpce sacharidů

If you use Oref1 with **SMB** you must change **min_5m_carbimpact** to 8. The value is only used during gaps in **CGM** readings or when physical activity "uses up" all the blood glucose rise that would otherwise cause **AAPS** to decay COB. At times when [carb absorption](../DailyLifeWithAaps/CobCalculation.md) can't be dynamically worked out based on your blood's reactions it inserts a default decay to your carbs. Basically, it is a failsafe.

(Config-Builder-aps)=

## APS

Select the desired APS algorithm for therapy adjustments. You can view the active detail of the chosen algorithm in the OpenAPS(OAPS) tab.

* OpenAPS AMA 
  * Advanced Meal Assist: older algorithm not recommended anymore.
  * In simple terms, the benefits are after you give yourself a meal bolus, the system can high-temp more quickly IF you enter carbs reliably.
* [OpenAPS SMB](#Open-APS-features-super-micro-bolus-smb) 
  * Super Micro Bolus: most recent algorithm recommended for all users.
  * In contrast to AMA, SMB does not use temporary basal rates to control glucose levels, but mainly small **Super Micro Boluses**.
  * Note : It is recommended to use this algorithm from the beginning, even though you will not actually get SMBs delivered until [Objective 9](#objectives-objective9).

If switching from AMA to SMB algorithm, *min_5m_carbimpact* must be changed manually to **8** (default value for SMB) in [Preferences > Sensitivity detection > Sensitivity Oref1 settings](../SettingUpAaps/Preferences.md).

## Smyčka

This module should not be disabled as it is a core part of **AAPS**.

## Constraints

### Objectives

**AAPS** has a learning program (a series of objectives) that you have to fulfill step by step. This should guide you safely through setting up a closed loop system. It guarantees that you have set everything up correctly and understand what the system does exactly. This is the only way you can trust the system.

See [Objectives](../SettingUpAaps/CompletingTheObjectives.md) page for more information.

## Synchronization

In this section, you can choose if/where you want **AAPS** to send your data to.

### NSClient or NSClientV3

Can be used as a [reporting server](../SettingUpAaps/SettingUpTheReportingServer.md) and/or for [remote monitoring](../RemoteFeatures/RemoteMonitoring.md), [remote control](../RemoteFeatures/RemoteControl.md).

See [Synchronization with the reporting server](#SetupWizard-synchronization-with-the-reporting-server-and-more) to help you choose between NSClient (v1) and NSClientV3.

### Tidepool

Can be used as a [reporting server](../SettingUpAaps/SettingUpTheReportingServer.md).

See [Tidepool](../SettingUpAaps/Tidepool.md).

### xDrip

Used to **send** data such as treatments to xDrip+.

### Open Humans

See [Open Humans](../SupportingAaps/OpenHumans.md).

### Wear

Monitor and control **AAPS** using your Android WearOS watch (see [page Watchfaces](../WearOS/WearOsSmartwatch.md)).

### Samsung Tizen

Broadcast data to Samsung's G-Watch Wear App (Tizen OS).

### Garmin

Connection to Garmin device (Fenix, Edge...)

## Ošetření

If you view the Treatments (Treat) tab, you can see the treatments that have been uploaded to nightscout. Should you wish to edit or delete an entry (e.g. you ate less carbs than you expected) then select 'Remove' and enter the new value (change the time if necessary) through the [carbs button on the home screen](#screens-bolus-carbs).

## General

### Přehled

This is the [main screen](#AapsScreens-the-homescreen) of **AAPS** and can not be disabled.

#### Zobrazovat kolonku poznámky v dialozích ošetření

Choose if you want to have a notes field when entering treatments or not.

#### Stavové indikátory

Choose if you want to have [status lights](#Preferences-status-lights) on overview for cannula age, insulin age, sensor age, battery age, reservoir level or battery level. When warning level is reached, the color of the status light will switch to yellow. Critical age will show up in red.

#### Pokročilá nastavení

**Deliver this part of bolus wizard result**: When using SMB, many people do not meal-bolus 100% of needed insulin, but only a part of it (e.g. 75 %) and let the SMB with UAM (unattended meal detection) do the rest. In this setting, you can choose a default value for the percentage the bolus wizard should calculate with. If this setting is 75 % and you had to bolus 10u, the bolus wizard will propose a meal bolus of only 7.5 units.

**Enable super bolus functionality in wizard** (It is different from *super micro bolus*!): Use with caution and do not enable until you learn what it really does. Basically, the basal for the next two hours is added to the bolus and a two hour zero-temp activated. **AAPS looping functions will be disabled - so use with care! If you use SMB AAPS looping functions will be disabled according to your settings in ["Max minutes of basal to limit SMB to"](#Open-APS-features-max-minutes-of-basal-to-limit-smb-to), if you do not use SMB looping functions will be disabled for two hours.** Details on super bolus can be found [here](https://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes-technology/blue-skying/super-bolus).
