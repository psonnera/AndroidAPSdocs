AAPS offer several options for remote monitoring of children and also allows to send remote commands. Of course you can also use remote monitoring to follow your partner or friend.

## Functions

- Kid's pump is controlled by kid's phone using AAPS.
- Parents can remotely follow seeing all relevant data such as glucose levels, carbs on board, insulin on board etc. using **AAPSClient app** on their phone. Settings must be the same in AAPS and AAPSClient app.
- Parents can be alarmed by using **xDrip+ app in follower mode** on their phone.
- Remote control of AAPS using [SMS Commands](../RemoteFeatures/SMSCommands.md) secured by two-factor authentication.
- Remote control through AAPSClient app is only recommended if your synchronization is working well (ie. you don’t see unwanted data changes like self modification of TT, TBR etc) see [release notes for Version 2.8.1.1](#important-hints-2-8-1-1) for further details.

## Tools and apps for remote monitoring

- [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/) in web browser (mainly data display)
- AAPSClient app is a stripped down version of AAPS capable of following somebody, making profile switches, setting TTs and entering carbs. There are 2 apps:  [AAPSClient & AAPSClient2 to download](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/releases/). The only difference is the app name. This way you can install the app twice on the same phone, to be able to follow 2 different persons/nightscouts with it.
- Dexcom follow if you are using original Dexcom app (BG values only)
- [xDrip+](../CompatibleCgms/xDrip.md) in follower mode (mainly BG values and **alarms**)
- [Sugarmate](https://sugarmate.io/) or [Spike](https://spike-app.com/) on iOS (mainly BG values and **alarms**)
- Some users find a full remote access tool like [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/) to be helpful for advanced remote troubleshooting

## Smartwatch options

A smartwatch can be a very useful tool in helping manage AAPS with kids. A couple of different configurations are possible:

- If AAPSClient is installed on the parents phone, the [AAPSClient WearOS app](https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS/releases/) can be installed on a compatible smartwatch connected to the parent's phone. This will show current BG, loop status and allow carb entry, temp targets and profile changes. It will NOT allow bolusing from the WearOS app.
- Alternatively, the [AAPS WearOS app](../WearOS/WearOsSmartwatch.md) can be built and installed on a compatible smartwatch, connected to the kid's phone but worn by the parent. This includes all the functions listed above as well as the ability to bolus insulin. This allows the parent to administer insulin without needing to remove the kid's phone from however it is kept on them.

## Things to consider

- Settings must be the same in AAPS and AAPSClient app.
- Consider time gap between master and follower due to time for up- and download as well as the fact that AAPS master phone will only upload after loop run.
- What is your emergency plan for when remote control does not work (_i.e._ network problems or lost bluetooth connection)?  Always consider what will happen with **AAPS** if you suddenly can’t send a new command. **AAPS** overwrites the pump basal, ISF and ICR with the current profile values. Only use temporary profile switches (_i.e._ with a set time duration) if switching to a stronger insulin profile, in case your remote connection is disrupted. Then the pump will revert to the original profile when the time expires.
