# DynamicISF (DynISF)
**Dynamic ISF** was added in **AAPS** version 3.2 and requires **[Objective 11](#objectives-objective11)** to be started before **Dynamic ISF** can be activated. Check **Enable dynamic sensitivity** in [Preferences > OpenAPS SMB](#Preferences-openaps-smb-settings) to activate. **Dynamic ISF** is recommended only for advanced users that have a good handle on their **AAPS'** controls and monitoring.

To use **Dynamic ISF** effectively, **AAPS'** database requires a minimum of five (5) days of the user's **AAPS** data.

**Dynamic ISF** adapts the user's insulin sensitivity factor (**ISF**) dynamically based on the user's:

- Total Daily Dose of insulin (**TDD**); and
- current and predicted blood glucose values.

**Dynamic ISF** uses Chris Wilson’s model to determine **ISF** instead of a user's static **Profile's** settings for **ISF**.

The **Dynamic ISF** equation implemented is: `ISF = 1800 / (TDD * Ln (( glucose / insulin divisor) +1 ))`

SMB/AMA - an example of a user's **Profile** with static **ISF** as set by the user and utilized by **SMB** and **AMA**.

The section circled in red shows: <br/> Alg:`DynamicISF value (based on TDD)`<br/> `profile ISF` -> `ISF as calculated by DynISF (used in SMB algorithm)` (`ISF used for COB calculations and bolus wizard`)

The implementation uses the above equation to calculate current **ISF** and in the oref1 predictions for **IOB**, **ZT** and **UAM**. It is also used for **COB** and in the bolus wizard. Further discussion can be found here: [Chris Wilson on Insulin Sensitivity (Correction Factor) with Loop and Learn, 2/6/2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL49FhOts3c).

## TDD (Total Daily Dose)
TDD will use a combination of the following values:
1.  7 day average **TDD**;
2.  the previous day’s **TDD**; and
3.  a weighted average of the last eight (8) hours of insulin use extrapolated out for 24 hours.

The **TDD** used in the above equation is weighted one third to each of the above values.

## Insulin Divisor
The insulin divisor depends on the peak of the insulin used and is inversely proportional to the peak time. For Lyumjev this value is 75, for Fiasp, 65 and regular rapid insulin, 55.

## Future ISF

Future **ISF** is used in the dosing decisions that oref1 makes.  Future **ISF** uses the same **TDD** value as generated above, taking the Adjustment Factor (discussed above) into account. It then uses different glucose values dependent on the case:

* If levels are flat, within +/- 3 mg/dl, and predicted **BG** is above target, a combination of 50% minimum predicted **BG** and 50% current **BG** is used.

* If eventual **BG** is above target and glucose levels are increasing, or eventual **BG** is above current **BG**, current **BG** is used.

Otherwise, minimum predicted **BG** is used.

## 설정

Check **Enable dynamic sensitivity** in [Preferences > OpenAPS SMB](#Preferences-openaps-smb-settings) to activate. New settings become available once checked.

### Dynamic ISF Adjustment Factor
The Adjustment Factor allows the user to specify a value between 1% and 300%. This acts as a multiplier on the **TDD** value and results in the **ISF** values becoming *smaller* (i.e. more insulin required to move glucose levels a small amount) as the value is increased above 100% and *larger* (i.e. less insulin required to move glucose levels a small amount) as the value is decreased below 100%.

### BG level below which low glucose suspend occurs

BG value below which insulin is suspended. Default value uses standard target model. User can set value between 60mg/dl (3.3mmol/l) and 100mg/dl(5.5mmol/l). Values below 65/3.6 result in use of default model.

### Enable TDD based sensitivity ratio for basal and glucose target modification

This setting replaces Autosens, and uses the last 24h **TDD**/7D **TDD** as the basis for increasing and decreasing basal rate, in the same way that standard Autosens does. This calculated value is also used to adjust target, if the options to adjust target with sensitivity are enabled. Unlike Autosens, this option does not adjust **ISF** values.

## CAUTION - Automations or Profile Percentage Increase
**Automations** should always be used with care. This is particularly so with **Dynamic ISF**.

If **Dynamic ISF** is in operation, users should reconsider enabling any temporary **Profile** increase as an **Automation** rule or similarly activating a **Profile Percentage** which may create **Dynamic ISF** to be overly aggressive in correction bolusing and could cause hypoglycemia.
