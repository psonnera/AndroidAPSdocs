# Update with a browser

## בנייה עצמית במקום הורדה

**AAPS** is not available to download, due to regulations concerning medical devices. בנייה עצמית של היישום לשימוש אישי הינה חוקית אך אסור לתת את היישום לאחרים! See [FAQ page](../UsefulLinks/FAQ.md) for details.

```{note}
In case you want to upgrade **AAPS** with a browser for the first time : copy your back-up keystore file to your Google Drive. Then follow the [Browser Build **AAPS** procedure](../SettingUpAaps/BrowserBuild.md) instead of this guide. Instead of creating a new keystore, you must select the one you have copied from your computer.
This operation will be mandatory only the first time, then for successive upgrades you will be able to follow this guide.
