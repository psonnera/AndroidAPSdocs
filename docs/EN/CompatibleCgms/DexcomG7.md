# Dexcom G7 and ONE+


##   Fundamental in advance

Noteworthy is the fact that the G7 and ONE+ systems, compared to the G6, do not smooth the values, neither in the app, nor in the reader. More details about this [here](https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/faqs/why-does-past-cgm-data-look-different-from-past-data-on-receiver-and-follow-app).

```

## 1. xDrip+ (direct connection to G7 or ONE+)

- Follow the instructions here: [xDrip+ G7](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.html)
- Select  xDrip+ in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](#Config-Builder-bg-source).

- Adjust the xDrip+ settings according to the explanations on the xDrip+ settings page  [xDrip+ settings](../CompatibleCgms/xDrip.md)

## 2.  Patched Dexcom G7 App (DiaKEM)

**Note: AAPS 3.2.0.0 or higher is required! Not available for ONE+.**

### Install a new patched (!) G7 app and start the sensor

WARNING --- There are reported issues **AAPS** receiving no BG data when using either DiaKEM as its data source. Users are recommended to use [X-Drip+](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CompatibleCgms/xDrip.html) as **AAPS'** BG data source until this issue has been resolved.


A patched Dexcom G7 app (DiaKEM) gives access to the Dexcom G7 data. This is not the BYODA app as this app can not receive G7 data at the moment.

- Uninstall the original Dexcom app if you used it before (A running sensor session can be continued - note the sensor code before removal of the app!)

- Download and install the patched.apk [here](https://github.com/authorgambel/g7/releases).

- Enter sensor code in the patched app.

- Follow the general recommendations for CGM hygiene and sensor placement found [here](../CompatibleCgms/GeneralCGMRecommendation.md).

- After the warm-up phase, the values are displayed as usual in the G7 app.

### Configuration in AAPS

- Select 'BYODA' in in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](#Config-Builder-bg-source) - even if it is not the BYODA app!

- If AAPS does not receive any values, switch to another BG source and then back to 'BYODA' to invoke the query for approving data exchange between AAPS and BYODA.

## 3. xDrip+ (companion mode) 

-   Download and install xDrip+: [xDrip](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) 
- As data source in xDrip+ "Companion App" must be selected and under Advanced Settings > Bluetooth Settings > "Companion Bluetooth" must be enabled.
-   Select  xDrip+ in in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](#Config-Builder-bg-source).

-   Adjust the xDrip+ settings according to the explanations on the xDrip+ settings page  [xDrip+ settings](../CompatibleCgms/xDrip.md)

## 4. Juggluco

Version 9.0+ required

- Disable the app previously connected to the sensor: Uninstall the app or use "Force Stop." Disable "Nearby Devices" permission in app settings. Restrict the app's battery usage.
  
- Forget the sensor in Bluetooth settings: In Android settings, find the sensor in bonded devices and select "Forget." Dexcom G7 sensor names start with DXCM.
  
- Avoid interference from other sensors: Keep old Dexcom sensors out of Bluetooth range.

- Connect the G7 sensor to Juggluco: Open Juggluco → Left menu → Photo. Scan the data matrix on the G7 sensor's applicator. Wait up to 5 minutes for Juggluco to find the sensor.

- Pairing requirements: Agree to pair the sensor with Juggluco. Ensure the screen isn’t locked during pairing. If pairing fails, wait 5 minutes before trying again.
 
- Exception: Wear OS watches can bond without pressing an agree button.
